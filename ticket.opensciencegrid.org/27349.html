That seems to have worked.  And thanks for the reminder to revert any changes to the blahp scripts.  I think we can close this ticket now.

Marian,

I might have a few questions about the configurations that you mentioned, but I&#39;ll ask them via email so that this ticket doesn&#39;t get too far off topic.  Thanks.

Cheers,

Were you able to apply the configuration I left in my link? Did it work out for you? If so, I think we can go ahead and close this ticket.

our HTCondor-CE/SLURM JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES look like as follows&#58;
$ condor_ce_config_val JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES
[ GridResource = &#34;batch pbs&#34;; TargetUniverse = 9; name = &#34;Local_PBS&#34;; set_default_queue = &#34;grid&#34;; set_default_maxMemory = 2000; ]

They seem to be simple as that and mapped to &#34;grid&#34; queue on the SLURM end. Is this what you&#39;re asking or what would like to do? I presumably think you might be perhaps also interested comparing now your /usr/libexec/blahp/pbs_local_submit_attributes.sh with UNL one - see attachment.

Please let me know if there is something else we could share regarding SLURM config part.

Thanks,
Marian

Yes, I&#39;m not sure why SLURM calls them partitions, but it is the same thing as queues.  Thanks for the link.  And thanks again for all your help with our migration.

Sorry I was limited support you adequately in the past week. Dan, I&#39;d suggest still record and cross-check settings we&#39;ve done in your osg32 htcondor-ce configs, namely some _NETWORK vars etc. Would be good to see when you upgrade to osg33 and upgrade all relevant htcondor packages if this is all equal to default values we ship within standard packaging. If you see any difference would be good try out default settings and see if it breaks things or not. If it breaks, we should consider wrap up your configs and use thier equivalent for the next releases. This would help to everyone else installing HTCondor-CE from scratch with presumably good-working environment and avoid changes you had done while troubleshooting.

Is the SLURM partition the same as a queue? If so, you should be able to
set that with the following&#58;

<a href='https&#58;//twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/JobRouterRecipes#Setting_a_default_batch_queue' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>https&#58;//twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/JobRouterRecipes#Setting_a_default_batch_queue</a>

If they&#39;re not the same, Marian may know how to specify it.

- Brian</pre></div><div class='update_description'><i onclick="document.location='27349#1457382275'; reset_anchor();" class="pull-right icon icon-share"></i><div class="header"><time datetime="2016-03-07T20:24:35+00:00">Mar 7, 2016 08:24 PM UTC</time><a class="anchor" name="1457382275">&nbsp;</a></div><pre>I think we may have figured out why HTCondor-CE wasn&#39;t picking up on the job completion.  We had SLURM&#39;s MinJobAge variable set to &#39;2&#39; so that completed jobs would be purged from the database after 2 seconds.  This increased performance for our SLURM server but it didn&#39;t allow enough time for HTCondor-CE to see that the job had completed.  Turning this up to a few minutes allowed HTCondor-CE enough time to catch the job state before it was purged from the DB.  Several jobs have completed successfully now.

Before we forget, though, can you let me know the correct way to specify which SLURM partition the jobs are sent to?  Thanks.

Thanks to everyone who worked with us through this troubleshooting.  Sorry it took so long but this is going to help us immensely.  Not only are we looking forward to the transition to HTCondor-CE but we&#39;ll be very happy to be migrated from LSF to SLURM.

Following your instructions, I found that the job was being submitted to the wrong queue in Slurm.  It was submitted to the default queue, but the nodes in the default queue don&#39;t have the condor spool directory mount and other necessary resources.  A while ago, I had a temporary solution of setting an alias in /etc/profile and /etc/bashrc so that &#39;sbatch&#39; would alias to &#39;sbatch -p ATLAS_Production&#39; but apparently that was overwritten (perhaps by our configuration management software).  So, to test that it would work with condor_ce_trace, I added the following to /usr/libexec/blahp/pbs_local_submit_attributes.sh&#58;

echo &#34;#PBS -q ATLAS_Production&#34;

Now, the test jobs submit to the ATLAS_Production queue in Slurm and complete.  But condor still sees them as IDLE.  For some reason, maybe related to the networking issues that I mentioned earlier, it&#39;s not seeing that they completed.  I&#39;m attaching the latest GridmanagerLog.usatlas1 (.txt) and removing the old one.  If there&#39;s another log file that would be helpful in tracking down this issue, let me know and I&#39;ll attach more.

I&#39;m sure that specifying the partition in /usr/libexec/blahp/pbs_local_submit_attributes.sh is not the correct way.  Is there a preferred way for specifying the partition, or would that all be done where the jobs originate?

Thanks!

There&#39;s a &#39;sleep 1&#39; line in pbs_submit.sh, could you add the following after that line?

echo $bls_tmp_file &#62; /tmp/pbs.sub

After that, run condor_ce_trace again and after the job gets held, you can inspect /tmp/pbs.sub and try to run &#39;qsub /tmp/pbs.sub&#39; to see if there are any obvious errors. Could you attach your blah.config? Also, it would be a good idea to install OSG 3.3 and update your Condor/blahp to the versions available in the latest repo.

Here&#39;s the version info for our blahp.
Name        &#58; blahp
Arch        &#58; x86_64
Version     &#58; 1.18.12.bosco
Release     &#58; 1.osg32.el6

I tried upgrading to the latest blahp (1.18.16).  It didn&#39;t complain about any dependency issues (didn&#39;t require any other packages to be upgraded) but since then our LSF queues aren&#39;t filling completely.  They are still receiving jobs, but not very many.  This reminds me of a problem we had last year when we upgraded to OSG 3.2.  I don&#39;t recall the solution in that case, but I remember Jose Caballero helped with the fix so I contacted him about this.  I rolled back to the older version of blahp (1.18.12) but the problem remains with the queues not filling.

Putting that problem on the back burner for now, I added &#39;blah_debug_save_submit_info=/scratch/blah&#39; to /etc/blah.config and gave /scratch/blah mode 777.  But nothing is appearing there when I run &#39;condor_ce_trace --debug net2.rc.fas.harvard.edu&#39; to submit a test job.  You said no service restarts required, but do I need to osg-configure or something else?  Also, I gave the directory mode 777 because I wasn&#39;t sure which user should own it.  The document says HTCondor-CE.  Does that mean the &#39;condor&#39; user?

As for the PERMISSION_DENIED errors, that IP is the public IP of our CE.

Just curious, what version of the blahp are you using? I ask because I
thought we added a fix for those completely unhelpful error messages
you&#39;re seeing.

I think we can ignore the 20-slurm.ini file for now if you&#39;ve got the
slurm-torque wrapper working.

As for the errors, this will involve some blahp troubleshooting. You&#39;ll
want to set blah_debug_submit_info
(<a href='https&#58;//twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/TroubleshootingHTCondorCE#BLAHP_Configuration_File' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>https&#58;//twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/TroubleshootingHTCondorCE#BLAHP_Configuration_File</a>)
to somewhere like /tmp. After you do that (no service restarts
required), you should run condor_ce_trace and look for
bl_*/submit.script files and inspect them for errors. Let me know if
those files/folders don&#39;t show up or if the files look ok.

I think we can ignore the PERMISSION_DENIED errors for now (do you
recognize the IP?).

Cheers,
Brian</pre></div><div class='update_description'><i onclick="document.location='27349#1456948875'; reset_anchor();" class="pull-right icon icon-share"></i><div class="header"><time datetime="2016-03-02T20:01:15+00:00">Mar 2, 2016 08:01 PM UTC</time><a class="anchor" name="1456948875">&nbsp;</a></div><pre>Hi Tim,

Unfortunately, no.  We haven&#39;t yet resolved the main issue of HTCondor-CE failing to submit to SLURM.  At the moment, Marian is in Europe for two weeks so our troubleshooting time may be slightly limited, though he is still online.  I&#39;ll try to summarize here where we are now.

I am configuring HTCondor-CE to submit to PBS and have installed the slurm-torque wrapper to translate PBS commands to SLURM.  This is the way that Marian has his site configured as well.  But I&#39;m a bit confused about what is the proper configuration when using SLURM.  I have enabled the use of the PBS job manager in OSG by setting &#39;enabled=True&#39; in /etc/osg/config.d/20-pbs.ini because we are using the slurm-torque wrapper, essentially enabling PBS commands.  This is also the way that Marian has his site configured.  However, there also exists the file /etc/osg/config.d/20-slurm.ini.  Should that also be enabled?  It even says the following in 20-slurm.ini&#58;

; Since we&#39;re using the PBS emulation in Slurm with the globus jobamanger,
; the jobmanager should be set to pbs
;job_contact = host.name/jobmanager-pbs

So, I&#39;m inclined to think that 20-slurm.ini should be enabled.  Then again, it says &#34;with the globus job manager&#34; so maybe this is not for use with HTCondor-CE?  But it says to use these files in the HTCondor-CE documentation (<a href='https&#58;//twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/InstallHTCondorCE#Configuring_the_batch_system' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>https&#58;//twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/InstallHTCondorCE#Configuring_the_batch_system</a>).  On the other hand, 20-pbs.ini is where we define pbs_binpath, the path to the PBS wrapper commands such as &#39;qsub&#39;.  This is all very confusing to me.

At the moment, 20-slurm.ini is disabled and 20-pbs.ini is enabled.  I have tested job submission to SLURM from the CE using the PBS commands provided by the slurm-torque wrapper.  However, when I try to submit a test job using &#39;condor_ce_trace --debug net2.rc.fas.harvard.edu&#39; the &#39;condor_ce_q -name net2.rc.fas.harvard.edu -pool net2.rc.fas.harvard.edu&#58;9619 -held&#39; command yields&#58;

And MasterLog is showing the following from time to time&#58;

This, we believe, may be related to the fact that the CE has two NICs - one with a private IP and one with a public IP.
<div id='show_86094947' class=''><button class="btn">Show More</button></div><div class='detail hidden' id='detail_86094947'>
However, when I enable LSF (in 20-lsf.ini) and use our LSF cluster, the jobs are successfully submitted.  This makes me think that the networking errors are not preventing HTCondor-CE from submitting to SLURM, though we should definitely look into them further.

Thoughts?

That&#39;s actually an issue with the documentation but the &#39;osg-ce-slurm&#39;
package is just a metapackage that requires the packages listed already.
Installing osg-ce-slurm should be enough to get you up and running.

I suspect osg-ce-slurm is related to the GRAM-CE, not HTCondor-CE. We don&#39;t have it installed at UNL on our working HTCondor-CE/SLURM setup. Though, it&#39;s good point and let me figure out the details that it&#39;s not confusing for anyone else.

Hope this helps until we get together on the chat this afternoon.

Can anyone here tell me about the &#39;osg-ce-slurm&#39; package in the &#39;osg&#39; repo?  Is this a required package for the installation/configuration of an HTCondor-CE/SLURM CE?  There&#39;s no mention of it in this document&#58;

But it looks like something that may be required.  I haven&#39;t installed it on my CE yet because I didn&#39;t see it anywhere in the docs.  So I&#39;m wondering if that may be part of the problems I&#39;m having.

Thanks.

So indeed, both ports for outside (inbound for factories sending stuff in to your site), and inbound/outbound on internal network. Anyway, we&#39;re still not there yet as we need to understand couple of other things before, just keep in mind such changes on the network level are necessary.

I&#39;ll poke around from the host hcc-marian.unl.edu [129.93.244.231]. However, be aware if you intend to use your CE as grid gateway for other jobs coming to you you definitely need both ports open to outside world - otherwise, I&#39;m not sure what should be purpose of your setup with HTCondor-CE.

Thanks for your willingness to help.

Regarding the network ports 9619 and 9620, our network engineer does not want to open those ports to the entire world so if you could provide me with your IP address, I can have him open the ports to you.  I have already submitted a request to have him open port 9619 to Brian and I am still waiting on a response.

So far, I have successfully tested job submission via HTCondor-CE to our LSF cluster using &#39;condor_ce_trace --debug net2.rc.fas.harvard.edu&#39; where net2.rc.fas.harvard.edu is our CE.  However, we are transitioning away from LSF to SLURM.  So, now I am trying to test job submission via HTCondor-CE to SLURM.  I have put the job router entries from /etc/condor-ce/config.d/02-ce-pbs.conf into 99-local.conf so that they are the last entries run.  I have also configured and enabled /etc/osg/config.d/20-slurm.ini and then run &#39;osg-configure -v; osg-configure -c&#39; to apply all changes.  When I attempt to test this by running &#39;condor_ce_trace --debug net2.rc.fas.harvard.edu&#39; from another host, the job is held by the CE and the following error is in /var/log/condor-ce/GridmanagerLog.usatlas1&#58;

01/15/16 15&#58;24&#58;53 [17172] (72.0) blah_job_submit() failed&#58; submission command failed (exit code = 1) (stdout&#58;) (stderr&#58;/usr/libexec/blahp/pbs_submit.sh&#58; line 207&#58; /qsub&#58; No such file or directory-)

It appears to me that HTCondor-CE is attempting to submit the job using PBS commands, which makes sense because I am using PBS job router entries (because there is no such file as 02-ce-slurm.conf).  However, we do not have PBS commands because we run SLURM and use &#39;sbatch&#39; to submit jobs rather than &#39;qsub&#39;.  I feel as though I&#39;m missing something obvious but I don&#39;t understand the correct way to tell HTCondor-CE to submit to SLURM instead of PBS because files such as 02-ce-slurm.conf don&#39;t exist.  This is why I&#39;m wondering if we should be using a PBS-to-SLURM translator so that our SLURM master can accept PBS submission commands.

I am including the files that you requested as the file named marian.tar.bz2.txt.  You&#39;ll need to remove the .txt extension and then unzip/untar it.  Let me know if you run into any problems accessing the files.

Thanks.

seems quite long thread - take some patience with me if I ask something what you already answered!

Dan, what your network people said about opening 9619 and 9620 on net2.rc.fas.harvard.edu? I can&#39;t seem to telnet any of those, it could help me understand couple of more things remotely, I believe.
Other than that, could you recollect you current configuration for me, please? Wrap the configs of /etc/osg/config.d and also of all files listed when you do &#96;condor_ce_config_val -config&#96; if you can?

I&#39;d like to make big picture what you&#39;ve got so far (not) running that I could discuss with you things like PBS-to-SLURM translator etc (which I wasn&#39;t aware of before) and later Job Routes at yours site... Though, if I could make some remote connects that would really help besides config files.

Thanks,

We use /usr/bin/sbatch for SLURM job submission.  I believe &#39;qsub&#39; is strictly a PBS program.  However, there is a PBS-to-SLURM translator that we could install at our site that would allow submission of jobs to SLURM using PBS commands.  Is that what we ought to do or is HTCondor-CE written with native SLURM support?

Since we&#39;re using SLURM, I didn&#39;t enable/configure 20-pbs.ini.  I only enabled/configured 20-slurm.ini but that seems to reference pbs as well.  I tried configuring 20-pbs.ini today but didn&#39;t know what to enter for &#39;pbs_server&#39;.

One other thing worth mentioning (though I don&#39;t think it&#39;s related to any problems we&#39;re having now) is this warning I see when I run &#39;osg-configure -v; osg-configure -c&#39;&#58;

SEG module &#34;pbs&#34; is not enabled

The SEG module is optional though, correct?

Also, I&#39;m still waiting to hear back from our networking team about port 9619 access for you.  I&#39;ll keep you posted about that.

Thanks.

Nah that&#39;s fine, this can stay in the one ticket. Everything you did was
right except replacing PBS with SLURM in 99-local.conf, that should stay
&#39;pbs&#39;. If you don&#39;t use &#39;qsub&#39; to submit SLURM jobs, what binary do you
guys use? Have you set the pbs_binpath in &#39;/etc/osg/config.d/20-pbs.ini&#39;
to point to the location of your SLURM binaries?

Sorry that this is becoming such a long thread again.  If you&#39;d like, I can start a new ticket for this bunch of SLURM questions that I&#39;m about to ask.  But for now, here they are...

I attempted to get HTCondor-CE to submit to SLURM by making the following config changes&#58;

-  I disabled LSF in /etc/osg/config.d/20-lsf.ini
-  I enabled SLURM in /etc/osg/config.d/20-slurm.ini
-  I copied the contents of /etc/condor-ce/config.d/02-ce-pbs.conf to 99-local.conf and commented out lines for LSF.  I used 02-ce-pbs.conf because there is no 02-ce-slurm.conf and I recalled that HTCondor-CE uses PBS with wrappers to submit to SLURM (is that correct?)
-  I ran &#39;osg-configure -v; osg-configure -c&#39; and verified that &#39;condor_ce_job_router_info -config | grep -i gridresource&#39; returned &#39;batch pbs&#39;.

Then I tested with &#39;condor_ce_trace --debug net2.rc.fas.harvard.edu&#39; but the jobs are being held.  What I&#39;m seeing in /var/log/condor-ce/GridmanagerLog.usatlas1 is the following&#58;
01/13/16 14&#58;40&#58;37 [12110] (64.0) blah_job_submit() failed&#58; submission command failed (exit code = 1) (stdout&#58;) (stderr&#58;/usr/libexec/blahp/pbs_submit.sh&#58; line 207&#58; /qsub&#58; No such file or directory-)
This makes sense because we&#39;re not actually using PBS so we wouldn&#39;t have &#39;qsub&#39;.

So, then I took a stab in the dark and changed the job router entries of 99-local.conf to look like this&#58;
JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = &#92;
[ &#92;
GridResource = &#34;batch slurm&#34;; &#92;
TargetUniverse = 9; &#92;
name = &#34;Local_SLURM&#34;; &#92;
]

After reconfiguring and submitting a condor_ce_trace, I&#39;m seeing the following in GridmanagerLog.usatlas1&#58;
01/13/16 13&#58;41&#58;36 [1229] (62.0) blah_job_submit() failed&#58; submission command failed (exit code = 2) (stdout&#58;) (stderr&#58;/usr/libexec/blahp/slurm_submit.sh&#58; No such file or directory)
And this is true - there is no slurm_submit.sh file there.  I assume that there shouldn&#39;t be and that it should be using pbs_submit.sh.

Was I on the right track with using PBS?

For now, I just want to get HTCondor-CE to accept ATLAS jobs.  The next step after we get it submitting to LSF will be to get the jobs into SLURM and rebuild our worker nodes as SLURM nodes so that we can get rid of LSF in our environment.  So I&#39;d like to keep the migration as simple as possible for now and then we can add OSG jobs later.  But while I&#39;m testing job submission, I&#39;d like to at least test that the CE can successfully connect to and submit to our SLURM master.  That shouldn&#39;t take me long, I hope.  Once I do that, what will be the next step towards testing jobs from the ATLAS factories?

1) The implementation of this depends a bit on ATLAS preferences. If the ATLAS job factories specify which queue they would like for each of their jobs then you shouldn&#39;t have to worry about it. However, if the factory submitted jobs don&#39;t explicitly provide that information and instead expect the sites to handle something like the proxy DN to separate jobs into the proper queues, then you&#39;ll have to write job routes.

2) That&#39;s to be expected, check out the following TWiki section&#58; <a href='https&#58;//twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/HTCondorCEOverview#On_other_batch_systems' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>https&#58;//twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/HTCondorCEOverview#On_other_batch_systems</a>

3) That&#39;s a temporary file that gets written and cleaned up. You can skip cleanup by specifying the &#39;-n&#39; option.

Do you plan on accepting OSG jobs or are you just setting this up for ATLAS? Because it sounds like we&#39;ve got some success and the next step is to start testing pilot jobs from the OSG or ATLAS factories.

It appears to me that we don&#39;t have to use Job Routes to get the incoming jobs to the correct queue on the local batch system - that will be specified by the incoming job itself, so all we have to do is direct the job to the correct batch system and it will land in the proper queue automatically.  Is that correct?

That did the trick!  Now it&#39;s submitting to LSF!  Thanks so much.

This immediately raises a few more questions, though (sorry).

1)  It&#39;s submitting to the default LSF queue.  With GRAM, we have the jobs divided into separate queues&#58; ATLAS_Production, ATLAS_Analysis, and ATLAS_MCORE.  In order to accomplish this with LSF, do I now need to learn about how to write Job Router Recipes as outlined here&#58; <a href='https&#58;//twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/JobRouterRecipes' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>https&#58;//twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/JobRouterRecipes</a>

2)  Whenever I run the single command &#39;condor_ce_trace --debug net2.rc.fas.harvard.edu&#39; two processes are spawned on the CE.  For example&#58;
55.0   usatlas1        1/7  12&#58;44   0+00&#58;00&#58;00 X  0   0.1  env
56.0   usatlas1        1/7  12&#58;44   0+00&#58;00&#58;00 C  0   0.1  env
Is this normal?

3)  I see mention of an output file (/n/home_rc/dcaunt/.stdout_28416_SpdWL_) in my home directory but I can&#39;t find the file.  Is it a temporary file that gets deleted?

This is probably because you probably have both 20-ce-lsf.conf and
20-ce-pbs.conf in /etc/condor-ce/config.d/ and since config files in
that dir are evaluated in alphanumerical order, the default PBS route is
overriding the default LSF route. You can copy the contents of
20-ce-lsf.conf into 99-local.conf to make sure that your routes are
being set appropriately. After you do that, run &#96;condor_ce_reconfig&#96; and
&#96;condor_ce_job_router_info -config | grep -i gridresource&#96; and ensure
that its value is set to &#39;batch lsf&#39;.

And I&#39;d need ports 9619 and 9620 open to the public on that host. SSH
access wouldn&#39;t give me much more unless I were given root and it&#39;s
definitely understandable if I can&#39;t get that level of access.

I&#39;m not sure if this would be easier to troubleshoot via phone but thanks.  Which ports would you need open in order to remotely troubleshoot the CE?  Some may be publicly accessible.  The hostname is net2.rc.fas.harvard.edu if you&#39;d like to try.  What we can also do is allow you ssh access to the CE.  I would just need you to fill out an account request form on our site (<a href='https&#58;//account.rc.fas.harvard.edu/request-wizard/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>https&#58;//account.rc.fas.harvard.edu/request-wizard/</a>) and I can approve it.  You&#39;d select &#34;Internal User&#34; and enter &#34;Margaret McFee&#34; as your sponsor.  It doesn&#39;t matter what is entered for the rest of the fields.

I changed the owner of the spool directory to condor&#58;condor and it appears to be working now.  It&#39;s odd because I&#39;m certain it was working before (there were even subdirectories created by the CE already on there) but I won&#39;t worry about that now.

I had to make a change to the CE config but I&#39;m still getting similar errors.  When I returned from my leave of absence late last year, I forgot that the migration plan involved getting HTCondor-CE to submit to LSF first and then migrating to SLURM.  So, the only changes I made since we last spoke are&#58; I disabled SLURM by setting &#34;enabled = FALSE&#34; in 20-slurm.ini and made sure &#34;enabled = TRUE&#34; in 20-lsf.ini, then re-ran &#39;osg-configure -v; osg-configure -c&#39; and restarted the condor-ce service.  What I&#39;m seeing is that the jobs are still being held&#58;

I don&#39;t have WebEx or anything of the sort but we could set up a phone call if that would help. Also, if your CE is publicly accessible, I could do a lot of remote troubleshooting from my end. Looking at your most recent error, it looks like your spool dir may have bad permissions (assuming your spool dir is &#39;/n/atlasgrid/condor&#39;), it should be owned by condor&#58;condor. Also, what kind of volume is the spool dir mounted on? Is it an NFS shared dir served from the CE itself?

Cheers,

I followed the instructions in the &#39;Known Issues&#39; section.  However, when I used &#39;localhost&#39; and re-ran osg-configure, it complained that about not being able to resolve localhost (even though I can &#39;ping localhost&#39;) so I entered the CE&#39;s FQDN instead and that seemed to make it happy.

Let&#39;s ignore my previous comments about 20-pbs.ini. Try setting slurm_binpath=/usr/local/bin/ (assuming that&#39;s where your slurm executables are) then submit a new job to see if that gets rid of that error message.

I don&#39;t believe I made any changes to /etc/osg/config.d/20-pbs.ini (it still has enabled=FALSE) because we&#39;re using SLURM so I instead configured /etc/osg/config.d/20-slurm.ini.  I remember there&#39;s a connection between PBS and SLURM in HTCondor-CE but I&#39;m not sure I completely understand it.  I&#39;m attaching my 20-slurm.ini and 20-pbs.ini in case you want to verify them.  I&#39;ll also attach /etc/blah.config because I don&#39;t think that&#39;s correct either since slurm_binpath is blank.  (Just remove the .txt from files.tar.txt)  However, running &#39;osg-configure -v; osg-configure -c&#39; yields the following&#58;

I see the following in your GridmanagerLog.usatlas1&#58;

12/11/15 16&#58;50&#58;02 [30763] GAHP[30772] -&#62; &#39;2&#39; &#39;1&#39; &#39;submission command failed (exit code = 1) (stdout&#58;) (stderr&#58;/usr/libexec/blahp/pbs_submit.sh&#58; line 207&#58; /qsub&#58; No such file or directory-)&#39; &#39;N/A&#39;

Have you configured pbs_location in /etc/osg/config.d/20-pbs.ini? If you haven&#39;t, you&#39;ll need to run &#96;osg-configure -v; osg-configure -c&#96;. The end goal should be that pbs_binpath gets set in /etc/blah.config.</pre></div><div class='update_description'><i onclick="document.location='27349#1449871989'; reset_anchor();" class="pull-right icon icon-share"></i><div class="header"><time datetime="2015-12-11T22:13:09+00:00">Dec 11, 2015 10:13 PM UTC</time><a class="anchor" name="1449871989">&nbsp;</a></div><pre>Thanks, Brian.  I created an alias (sbatch = sbatch -p ATLAS_Production) on the CE in an attempt to ensure that all jobs are submitted to the newly created SLURM partition.  And I increased the log level as you suggested.  After running &#39;condor_ce_trace --debug net2.rc.fas.harvard.edu&#39; on the remote host, I get a similar output as before.  I&#39;ll paste that output below.  And I&#39;ll attach the requested log files.  Just remove the .txt extension from the filename.

Thanks.
Dan

I haven&#39;t gotten the job to submit to the worker node yet.  It returns &#34;Job status&#58; Held&#34; just like below and a job never appears on the WN.  I haven&#39;t had much time in the past few days to troubleshoot because of other projects but I intend to look at it again this afternoon.  Are there any log files that I could submit that may allow you to see where the job is getting stuck?

Thank you.

If you followed the OSG&#39;s HTCondor-CE installation instructions, the default configuration will use the SLURM binaries on the CE to submit jobs to your SLURM backend. If by default the SLURM binaries submit to your intended partition, you shouldn&#39;t have to add any more configuration.

Just a quick update.  I got a worker node configured for SLURM.  I added it to a SLURM partition that I just created for the purposes of testing (called ATLAS_Production).  I don&#39;t remember ever having configured HTCondorCE to know the name of the SLURM partition where it should submit.  I assume that&#39;s done with a Job Router Recipe as described here&#58;

<a href='https&#58;//twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/JobRouterRecipes' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>https&#58;//twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/JobRouterRecipes</a>

I&#39;m going to create a recipe next.  If there&#39;s anything else that I need to do at this point, please let me know.

Thanks.

Sorry for the slow progress.  I&#39;ve been out sick for the past few days.  But I have been getting a worker node set up.  I hope to have a good test in the next few days.  Thanks for your patience.

Running condor_ce_trace from a remote host (a repurposed worker node) seems to have worked.  I&#39;m posting the output below in case you can see anything that I should be concerned about.  I don&#39;t have any worker nodes configured to interface with HTCondorCE/SLURM yet so this is why the &#34;Querying job status&#34; doesn&#39;t return any worker node information.  Unless you can see anything curious in the output below, I&#39;ll continue with the installation instructions and let you know if I run into any further questions.  Thanks.

Software,

Please look in to this as I am out of the office for the rest of the week.  Thank you.

This service request is in reference to ticket 26367 (<a href='26367.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>https&#58;//ticket.opensciencegrid.org/26367</a>).

As suggested, I&#39;m trying to run condor_ce_trace from a host other than the CE.  I don&#39;t currently have a host with the necessary tools on it, so I&#39;m trying to install them.  I have installed &#39;voms-clients&#39; in order to have &#39;voms-proxy-init&#39; but when I run &#39;voms-proxy-init&#39; I get the following&#58;

unable to access trusted certificates in&#58;x509_cert_dir=/etc/grid-security/certificates
Function&#58; proxy_init_cred

Can you please remind me the process I need to follow in order to be able to run voms-proxy-init from this host (it&#39;s a worker node that I have temporarily taken offline for this testing)?  If there is a document I can follow, please point me to it and I will gladly follow the document.

Thank you!
Dan
