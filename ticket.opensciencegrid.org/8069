Sure, go ahead and deploy the generic OR-based logic. But let&#39;s be

P.S. Sorry to not respond earlier--I was out on vacation last week.

I am still waiting on John&#39;s/ATLAS&#39; ack. on the following point from that note&#58;

&#34;This sounds like a special case we would have to put in just for ATLAS bound tickets coming in from GGUS. Right now we assign any support center (assignee or TX based) that matches a resource/resource_group&#39;s site&#39;s SC *or* a concerned VO&#39;s application support center. I would like to deploy this, and see how it goes, and if in the future it turns out to be a big issue not having the above special case you have described, we can deal with it. Does this sound reasonable? [I&#39;ll add a note that ATLAS wishes the above special case in our GOC-TX document]&#34;

Thanks for re-posting your note. See inline below&#58;

<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62; The SMS message/special email part is handled directly by GGUS, so you won&#39;t need to worry about that. The ticket part of an alarm ticket gets</font>
sent like any other ticket, so it should be handled normally. There was a case where we got neither the ticket, nor the SMS message, and GGUS is
looking into this.

Ok, I will assume from a GOC stand point that you will work out alarm txt message issues directly AND that everything else is working normally from our end i.e if a GGUS ticket comes to GOC, and needs to be forwarded to ATLAS, then that is happening just fine.

<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62; Ah, OK. Thanks for clarifying. The process you describe sounds just fine. As you say, #2 should be &#34;refer to a resource or resource group</font>
that lies under the BNL_ATLAS site&#34;.

Correct. Thanks, I consider this a closed issue.

<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62; That sounds good, with the caveat that this match should occur only if the R-&#62;RG-&#62;Site matching fails. We have Tier 2 sites that may, in the</font>
future, wish to directly receive their tickets rather than have their tickets go to the Tier 1.

While we wait for your response to be resent, I thought I&#39;ll give an update from our end.

The code {to assign a support center if a concerned_VO value is provided, matches an OIM VO (case-insensitive comparison), and matching VO has a support center} is in place in our development instance. We are in the middle of testing the code out but have been set back because of some necessary changes on the GGUS-dev system that have not happened yet. We have also let Rob Quick know about this, and have requested permission to deploy the code update on the production GOC-TX service once the above mentioned testing is complete. [Remember GOC is in a production deployment freeze, so this could take till mid-March before it gets deployed though it&#39;s Rob and management&#39;s call at the end of the day]

I suspect this ticket is almost ready to be closed. Three more items - please ack.

1) From <a href='8069.html#1265646929' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>https&#58;//ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8069#1265646929</a>

<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;&#62;&#62; There have been at least a couple (possibly more) GGUS tickets that never seem to have made it to BNL&#39;s RT queue. At least two of these have been ALARM tickets.</font>

<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62; Can you please specify the ALARM tickets that are among the &#34;at least a couple (possibly more) GGUS tickets&#34;? Note that alarms are directly sent by GGUS, and have no GOC involvement. I see none except the one mentioned below.</font>

Can you confirm ALARM is working and/or you are working with GGUS to ensure it is working? I never got any confirmation on this thus far. (I am aware that Rob is going to be receiving these text messages for the foreseeable future, so perhaps he knows)

2) From <a href='8069.html#1265649066' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>https&#58;//ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8069#1265649066</a>

<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;&#62; -- *All* GGUS tickets that come to OSG (alarm, regular, team tickets) that 1) have &#34;Concerned VO&#58; atlas&#34; or 2) mention BNL in the site, should</font>
be forwarded to BNL&#39;s RT system in the GridServices queue.

I addressed how requirement #1 is brand new but missed an important detail that Soichi caught.

We do *not* check for any occurrence of the value &#34;BNL&#34; in the SiteName field passed to us by GGUS. We grab the value of the SiteName field, and go up the OIM hierarchy resource-&#62;resource_group-&#62;Site, and look up the support center (which could happen to be USATLAS i.e BNL&#39;s RT system), and assign the ticket to that support center. I hope you clearly understand this difference.

Therefore, if a resource admin for a resource with name &#34;BNL_FOO&#34; erroneously or rightfully chooses a different support center, the ticket will go to that support center. Case in point&#58; STAR-BNL which is (correctly) supported by the STAR support center.

3) ETA on concerned VO based SC assignment

Per your last note <a href='8069.html#1265734746' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>https&#58;//ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8069#1265734746</a> - we will add code in GOC-TX so that tickets with Concerned VO value will be assigned to an SC for an OSG VO IF the VO name matches an OIM VO name. Therefore, if GGUS passes some version of the value &#34;ATLAS&#34; (case insensitive) for that field, then the ticket will be forwarded to the USATLAS SC.

Rob Quick has directed our team to freeze changes to production production system till the end of this month. Therefore the earliest we expect to have this feature in the production GOC-TX is by March 9th. We will send you a note when it is in place (I have noted that I&#39;ll do so in our internal tracker)

Can you please acknowledge/answer my questions in bullet points #1, #2, and #3? Then we could close out this ticket.

Thanks,

We agree that no special-case code should be needed in Footprints.
Matching &#39;concerned VO&#39; against the VO name in OIM is fine by us, with
the provision that it should be a case-insensitive match (to cope with
odd Atlas/atlas/ATLAS variations.

I think it might be nice to demand that GGUS never send tickets without
a valid OSG/OIM VO name, but that seems pretty strict. If OSG doesn&#39;t
recognize the VO, just ignore that field.

Cheers,

John,

That still does not answer my question in <a href='8069.html#1265657642' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>https&#58;//ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8069#1265657642</a> precisely enough. The key is we will NOT put some special case code in our very large and generic application for ATLAS -- it&#39;s not scalable, not maintainable, so forth.

So we either need to agree on &#34;This will work as long as GGUS keeps the VO name ATLAS the same as it is defined in OIM (coincidentally ATLAS)&#34; or we need to make some agreement with GGUS that they will ONLY send tickets to OSG if a VO chosen is in OIM. WIthout that we are looking at a chancy system. If you would like me to explain this over the phone, let me know.

Ok good deal. I&#39;d re-iterate from our end that the goal never went away from our perspective either. However, the sudden transition to the new setup meant we did not have all the features in GOC-TX yet.

I&#39;d also add that your line above is quite generic in that yes, of course, we would want every automatizable (new word?!) to be automated but we will only automate things documented in our GOCTX_Settings document which I shared earlier on this thread.

That did happen earlier today when we were aggressively testing the exchange in connection with this discussion, and when we initially used our dev instance (which is what we try to do unless it&#39;s problematic).

However, we get a list of blacklisted email addresses periodically, and we caught the problem almost immediately.

And we have already worked with Jason on ensuring the existing (soon to be replaced) ticket exchange does not loop irrespective of which Footprints project (production or dev) the email goes out from.

Re&#58; auto-assignment of tickets if &#34;Concerned VO = atlas&#34;, we just realized that this new requirement is not as simple as I thought it was going to be. The list displayed by GGUS as &#34;concerned VO&#34; has no connection to the OSG topology (i.e OIM). So they could have any value in there including a value for ATLAS that atlas/usatlas/aTlas/etc. And we have no way to confirm. In any case, I will open a separate ticket to discuss this with you folks as well as the GGUS developer, and perhaps we can figure out something to make it work.

Till we figure the whole thing out, the best we could do is something like this&#58;
isConcernedVOSetByGGUS () {
isConcernedVOValueInOIM(voname){  // do case insensitive search
autoAssignTicketToVOSC (voname);
}
}

Let us know if you&#39;d like such a setup to be in place or if you&#39;d prefer to discuss this at length in a separate ticket with GGUS. We would be averse to including a lower level hack (than the pseudo-code mentioned above) to just re-assign tickets if concerned VO = atlas to the BNL-RT, that is not very maintainable setup.

I tested this, and it took only a couple of minutes for a ticket to be sent to GOC, and (automatically) assigned to ATLAS; and the ack from BNL-RT made it back to GGUS within a 4 minute differential. See URLs below for reference.

To clarify my/our previous understanding&#58;

-- *All* GGUS tickets that come to OSG (alarm, regular, team tickets)
that 1) have &#34;Concerned VO&#58; atlas&#34; or 2) mention BNL in the site, should
be forwarded to BNL&#39;s RT system in the GridServices queue.

-- The ticket forwarding was automatic and therefore instantaneous for
all tickets that mention an identifiable ATLAS/BNL attribute.

I think there will be more discussion, but I just wanted to clarify
those two points.

Cheers,

Hiro - see <a href='8069.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>https&#58;//ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8069</a> for details. We do not have automatic assignment of incoming GGUS-&#62; GOC tickets to ATLAS though we expect to have it within a day or two. However, I would assume you get the alarm instantaneously given GGUS sends it directly outside of GOC involvement. ALso note that there is a delay in GGUS assignments potentially at the TPM level and/or sending of a ticket content to GOC (because of spam filter like mechanism that GUenter can explain better than I can) that we (GOC) are not able to do anything about. --ag</pre></div><div class='update_description'><i onclick="document.location='8069#1265646929'; reset_anchor();" class="pull-right icon icon-share"></i><div class="header"><time datetime="2010-02-08T16:35:29+00:00">Feb 8, 2010 04:35 PM UTC</time> by <b>Arvind Gopu</b><a class="anchor" name="1265646929">&nbsp;</a></div><pre>Ruth wants Dan to be part of this discussion except most of the discussion has already occurred before Dan joined the thread, so I am going to dump the emails here -- I request that you PLEASE continue the discussion here so anyone with interest can get the background without having to be CCed in an email.

Subject&#58; GGUS-OSG ticketing not working.

Hi Rob,

There have been at least a couple (possibly more) GGUS tickets that never seem to have made it to BNL&#39;s RT queue. At least two of these have been ALARM tickets.

More info&#58;

<a href='8069.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>https&#58;//ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8069</a>

Can someone at the GOC look into this ASAP and let us know what might have happened? If it is an issue on the GGUS end we need to know in order to pursue it there.

I emailed about the problem last week, and my email was converted to a ticket. But there has been no further update.

2) Arvind responded&#58;

John,

First, background that is likely unrelated to any of this&#58; We moved to a new ticket exchange setup, and are still working out some minor details. Automatic assignment based on ResourceGroup is not there yet in GOC-TX, so GOC staff have to assign tickets to USATLAS manually for the next few days.

However, I see nothing wrong with  <a href='https&#58;//gus.fzk.de/ws/ticket_info.php?ticket=55326' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>https&#58;//gus.fzk.de/ws/ticket_info.php?ticket=55326</a> - this ticket only came in last night. It rightfully created a normal priority ticket on the GOC side, and this ticket is on it way to ATLAS. Once automatic ticket assignment is in place, the move to ATLAS would be faster (almost immediate).

<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;&#62; There have been at least a couple (possibly more) GGUS tickets that never seem to have made it to BNL&#39;s RT queue. At least two of these have been ALARM tickets.</font>

Can you please specify the ALARM tickets that are among the &#34;at least a couple (possibly more) GGUS tickets&#34;? Note that alarms are directly sent by GGUS, and have no GOC involvement. I see none except the one mentioned below.

This appears to be a query from you about <a href='https&#58;//gus.fzk.de/ws/ticket_info.php?ticket=55263' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>https&#58;//gus.fzk.de/ws/ticket_info.php?ticket=55263</a> -- which is a ticket on which GGUS **directly** sent an alarm txt message to  6314879307@.... -- can you confirm you (did not get) got the alarm?

As far as USATLAS not being assigned on the ticket, I spoke to Kyle, he closed down the test ticket given the exchange between GGUS and GOC worked fine. There was nothing in the ticket that openly said &#34;Send this to USATLAS&#34;, so he closed down the ticket. If you&#39;d like to test GGUS alarms again, let us know and we will be happy to do that. We will be sure to ask GGUS to specify this ticket needs to go USATLAS (apart from their alarm test itself).
Again, once automatic assignment of tickets based on RG value is in place, manual assignment won&#39;t be necessary.

<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;&#62; Can someone at the GOC look into this ASAP and let us know what might have happened? If it is an issue on the GGUS end we need to know in order to pursue it there.</font>

If you did not get an &#34;alarm&#34; txt message at 6314879307@.... (which is what is listed on OIM) then you&#39;ll have to work with GGUS. We are happy to help with the communication channel but the deployment is entirely on the GGUS end. If you are just looking for a test ALARM ticket to be assignment to USATLAS we will be happy to do that assuming GGUS specifies such a request.

3) John had a followup

Hi Arvind,

This was an alarm ticket that we don&#39;t believe we got&#58;

<a href='https&#58;//gus.fzk.de/ws/ticket_info.php?ticket=55263' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>https&#58;//gus.fzk.de/ws/ticket_info.php?ticket=55263</a>

My understanding (others should comment) was that alarm tickets go through the same normal GGUS-&#62;OSG-&#62;BNL chain as regular tickets--just with extra steps taken at GGUS (e.g. SMS message sent).

That OSG is listed as a reciever on the ticket above suggests this.

4) Arvind responded

Hi John,

I believe I&#39;ve addressed in my previous response, a snippet of which I am copying and pasting here&#58;

This appears to be a query from you about  <a href='https&#58;//gus.fzk.de/ws/ticket_info.php?ticket=55263' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>https&#58;//gus.fzk.de/ws/ticket_info.php?ticket=55263</a> -- which is a ticket  on which GGUS **directly** sent an alarm txt message to

As far as USATLAS not being assigned on the ticket, I spoke to Kyle, he  closed down the test ticket given the exchange between GGUS and GOC worked fine. There was nothing in the ticket that openly said &#34;Send this  to USATLAS&#34;, so he closed down the ticket.

Again, once automatic assignment of tickets based on RG value is in place, manual assignment won&#39;t be necessary.

If there are more ALARM tickets you suspect had problems you&#39;d like us to chase let us know. Otherwise, I will assume there was only one test ALARM ticket, (and that presumably did not send a txt message to you), and that the only problem you are referring to is the fact the ticket did not additionally get assigned to USATLAS as explained above.

<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62; My understanding (others should comment) was that alarm tickets go through the same normal GGUS-&#62;OSG-&#62;BNL chain as regular tickets--just with extra steps taken at GGUS (e.g. SMS message sent).</font>

Correct. We have a bit more leeway for test ticket. In my personal experience, I usually annotate test tickets so it&#39;s clear to all parties involved as to what&#39;s going. In this case, there was no such annotation which combined with the fact that GOC-TX does not have automatic SC assignment made it trickier than it usually would be.

5) Michael said, and Kyle responded &#58;

Another GGUS alarm ticket was submitted against BNL earlier today
The ticket is <a href='https&#58;//gus.fzk.de/ws/ticket_info.php?ticket=55367' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>https&#58;//gus.fzk.de/ws/ticket_info.php?ticket=55367</a>

Hiro found it at the GOC, but it was not forwarded to BNL-RT.

Michael

This is what Hiro found&#58;

I can see that GGUS sent the ticket to GOC-OSG.  And, I can see in GOC-OSG that the ticket is still in the ticket system waiting to be re-assinged to BNL for last 11 minutes.  The corresponding GOC-OSG ticket can be found at <a href='8086.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>https&#58;//ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8086</a>

But, I have no idea who/what is responsible to send it to BNL RT.

Michael
----

FYI...There was another alarm this morning that I sent to USATLAS.

Kyle

------------------

6) Soichi said in response to bullet #1

Automatic assignment of the support center based on GGUS&#39;s notified site field is currently done manually - due to the new GOC-TX not supporting this feature yet.

7) Michael had a follow up question&#58;

So, what does that mean?

Are you telling us that GGUS tickets are no longer automatically routed via the OSG/GOC to the BNL RT system?

If the latter is the case I have 2 issues
1)       The GOC has not notified us as to the change in behavior
2)       Not getting GGUS tickets routed to BNL at low latency (&#60; 5 minutes), a feature we were promised by OSG operations, is not acceptable

In summary, I hope this is a misunderstanding and I trust the whole issue will be clarified by the OSG GOC management in the next few hours.

Michael

-----------------

8) Arvind responded further&#58;

Please see my note from a few minutes ago, and let me know if you still have questions.

Re&#58; not letting USATLAS know, we have been announcing all the changes, and limitations that are being addressed, etc. in the OPS call. Have you talked to the USATLAS representative(s) in the OPS call?

Subject&#58; Alarm ticket
Date-Sent&#58; Thursday, February 04, 2010 10&#58;46 AM -0500

Hi all,

We don&#39;t think we received a GGUS alarm ticket, so we&#39;d like to investigate what
happened.

The GGUS ticket is here&#58;
<a href='https&#58;//gus.fzk.de/ws/ticket_info.php?ticket=55263' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>https&#58;//gus.fzk.de/ws/ticket_info.php?ticket=55263</a>

In the trace it says the notified site was BNL_ATLAS_1, and was set
&#34;solved(OSG(Prod))&#34; by Kyle via Footprints at 21&#58;56 on Feb 3. But we don&#39;t think we
ever received an OSG ticket on our BNL RT system.

Can you track which BNL RT ticket number is/was associated with the GGUS ticket 55263?

Thanks,

--john
