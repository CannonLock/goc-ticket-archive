I&#39;m sorry to report that this seems to be occurring again.

Tom has talked with our DNS admins who say that they have not made any changes that would have reverted the earlier fix. Tom is going to try rerunning the tests from before to get more info.

I assume you guys haven&#39;t changed anything on your side that would cause this?

Thanks,

Obviously I hope they can just add the -4 option to their bind command lines.

They need to start bind with -4 to completely disable ipv6.

cilogon.org triggers this problem more often than other domains because the name server A records have a lower ttl than the AAAA records.  When ipv6 is not disabled the ns address cache ends up in a state where there is no v4 record but there is a v6 record that has been declared to be bogus, and the next query will fail.

Other domains will show this problem as well with enough testing, as you saw with incommon.org.

Servers answering 129.79.1.1 are not running on dual stack, but we have those named configured to not query any IPv6 nameservers(server &#58;&#58;/0 { bogus yes; }).

These days there are lots of domains hosted by nameservers with both v4 and v6 addresses, I would think we are going to see much large scale of failures if there is problem, for example there are six nameservers for isc.org, three ipv4 and three ipv6, www.isc.org is a hostname we monitor to check our dns health every 2 mins, we never have problem to resolve isc.org.</pre></div><div class='update_description'><i onclick="document.location='31212#1474563010'; reset_anchor();" class="pull-right icon icon-share"></i><div class="header"><time datetime="2016-09-22T16:50:10+00:00">Sep 22, 2016 04:50 PM UTC</time> by <b>jazoff@....</b><a class="anchor" name="1474563010">&nbsp;</a></div><pre>The program sends regular A queries.

You can modify the python program to use

cmd = [&#39;host&#39;, &#39;-vt&#39;, &#39;A&#39;, &#39;osg.cilogon.org.&#39;, &#39;129.79.1.1&#39;]

or change the shell loop to

while /bin/true; do out=$(host -v -t A osg.cilogon.org. 129.79.1.1); if [[ ${out/141.142.149.28/} == $out ]]; then date; echo $out; fi; sleep 30; done

to show that the host tool will fail in the same way.

You can tell them the same thing I have been saying since day one, the servers do not have a functional ipv6 stack and do not have bind running in v4 only mode.

&#34;Empty response&#34; is from a SERVFAIL.. I did a bad job at printing the actual error code, but that is what causes a response that is empty.

In a few cases we got 3 failures in a row. Failures appeared during lookups against 129.79.1.1 (an IU DNS server) and against 127.0.0.1 (localhost&#39;s caching/forwarding DNS server, which forwards these requests to IU DNS servers 129.79.1.1 and 129.79.5.100 in that order).

Does this look as if the problem may be in IU&#39;s DNS server? It does look like that to me, but I didn&#39;t write this test code and don&#39;t know all the ins and outs of DNS. Here are the errors that occurred after the ones I posted previously.

In each of these cases the single error was followed by a correct response.

Again, more later.</pre></div><div class='update_description'><i onclick="document.location='31212#1474299190'; reset_anchor();" class="pull-right icon icon-share"></i><div class="header"><time datetime="2016-09-19T15:33:10+00:00">Sep 19, 2016 03:33 PM UTC</time> by <b>jazoff@....</b><a class="anchor" name="1474299190">&nbsp;</a></div><pre>If you can just run the go program I wrote (<a href='https&#58;//github.com/ncsa/dns-infra-check' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>https&#58;//github.com/ncsa/dns-infra-check</a>) like

every 30 seconds or so and wait for error output, it will tell you what is broken.

Also, a previous email from you stated &#34;lookups not found in the cache go to the university&#39;s DNS servers&#34; but I&#39;m not sure if anyone from the university has been contacted about this problem.  It would be a mistake to assume that their servers are configured properly for v6 lookups.

Our primary DNS/LDAP server is running RHEL 5 and will need to be updated soon anyway. The backup one is running RHEL 6. One possibility is that RHEL 5&#39;s IPv6 support is somehow incomplete. Every test that I know how to do indicates that IPv6 is working fine on the primary server, but that doesn&#39;t mean that there aren&#39;t problems in corner cases.

I&#39;ve set up a test VM and pointed its DNS and LDAP at the backup server, going so far as to put in a firewall rule blocking all outgoing packets to the primary. I can&#39;t even ping the primary from the test VM now. All DNS and LDAP queries are definitely going to the backup, which runs on RHEL 6. Now I&#39;m running the DNS test script on this test VM. We&#39;ll see whether there are any lookup failures on osg.cilogon.org from this setup. If there aren&#39;t any, that&#39;ll indicate that it&#39;s something to do with the primary server. However, if there are failures, we&#39;ll be back to not knowing exactly where the problem is.</pre></div><div class='update_description'><i onclick="document.location='31212#1474294723'; reset_anchor();" class="pull-right icon icon-share"></i><div class="header"><time datetime="2016-09-19T14:18:43+00:00">Sep 19, 2016 02:18 PM UTC</time> by <b>Sarah Schmiechen</b><a class="anchor" name="1474294723">&nbsp;</a></div><pre>All, I&#39;m going to work on adding a DNS query in before the request is made, and blocking on retrying that for a minute or so.

The script I&#39;m using attempts to resolve osg.cilogon.org every 30 seconds and reports when this lookup fails. I&#39;ve inserted a &#34;-&#34; myself to indicate successive failures. Justin Azoff stated that bind has a 10-minute TTL for caching server failures, and the fact that these happen no more frequently than once every 10 minutes suggested that it was due to a server failure somewhere in the forwarding chain. However, it is not the case that they happen no more frequently than once per 10 minutes. It is still possible that there is a server failure (perhaps on our end, perhaps not) causing the failures that appear to happen on a 10-minute schedule, but there may be another separate issue as well that causes the others.</pre></div><div class='update_description'><i onclick="document.location='31212#1473858879'; reset_anchor();" class="pull-right icon icon-share"></i><div class="header"><time datetime="2016-09-14T13:14:39+00:00">Sep 14, 2016 01:14 PM UTC</time> by <b>Sarah Schmiechen</b><a class="anchor" name="1473858879">&nbsp;</a></div><pre>Still no more failures since that date.

import time

cmd = [&#39;host&#39;, &#39;-vt&#39;, &#39;A&#39;, &#39;osg.cilogon.org.&#39;]

The hypothesis is that this is due to&#58;

* The NS records for cilogon.org point to entries for which there are AAAA records
* A dual-stacked server somewhere in the DNS resolving/forwarding chain sees those AAAA records and attempts to contact them via IPv6
* However, that server&#39;s IPv6 is not functioning correctly, so that attempt fails
* This failure is cached, for 10 minutes by default, before the same attempt is made again
* In the meantime, IPv4 is used, which works correctly

We are not, however, certain which server exactly is causing this problem, and it is apparently impossible to determine whether this issue has been resolved other than by making repeated DNS queries for osg.cilogon.org and seeing if any of them fail over a 10 or more minute period.

Is this accurate? Please correct this if it is not.</pre></div><div class='update_description'><i onclick="document.location='31212#1473705491'; reset_anchor();" class="pull-right icon icon-share"></i><div class="header"><time datetime="2016-09-12T18:38:11+00:00">Sep 12, 2016 06:38 PM UTC</time> by <b>Scott Teige</b><a class="anchor" name="1473705491">&nbsp;</a></div><pre>Adding some cc&#39;s and assignees, hoping to get the appropriate folks together so we can understand this.</pre></div><div class='update_description'><i onclick="document.location='31212#1473702084'; reset_anchor();" class="pull-right icon icon-share"></i><div class="header"><time datetime="2016-09-12T17:41:24+00:00">Sep 12, 2016 05:41 PM UTC</time> by <b>Sarah Schmiechen</b><a class="anchor" name="1473702084">&nbsp;</a></div><pre>We have been having intermittent failures when issuing host certs via CILogon. Here is an example&#58;

<a href='15865.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>https&#58;//ticket.opensciencegrid.org/15865</a>

with the relevant error being &#34;Failed to sign certificate -- CertificateProviderException  &#58;&#58; From CILogon&#58; Failed to make cilogon/rest request&#58; java.net.UnknownHostException&#58; osg.cilogon.org&#34;.

Justin Azoff from CILogon has said&#58;

&#34;All of the cilogon.org related servers are fine, the problem is that there are AAAA records configured for the NS records and bind is not smart enough to realize that ipv6 is not functional before it repeatedly attempts to contact them.
There are DNS records at other times because after an NS server fails to be contacted bind waits UNREACH_HOLD_TIME before trying it again.  This is why the lookup will fail every 10 minutes.
The problem is that your resolvers are still unable to contact the name servers for cilogon.org, most likely because ipv6 is still not fully functional on all resolvers.  If you test it, incommon.org should show the same issues.&#34;

However, the python script we are running to collect the information about incommon.org has not produced any results, unlike the script running for CILogon which fails intermittently with &#34;Host osg.cilogon.org not found&#58; 2(SERVFAIL)&#34;</pre></div><legend>Similar Recent Tickets <small>modified within the last 30 days</small></legend><div id="similar_tickets"><p class="muted">No similar tickets found.</p></div>
