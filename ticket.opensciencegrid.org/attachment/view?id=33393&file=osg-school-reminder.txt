If you could access hundreds or even thousands of computers for your
scholarly work, what could you do? How could it transform your work?
What discoveries might you make?

We are seeking applicants for the Open Science Grid (OSG) User School
2017, which takes place July 17-21 at the beautiful University of
Wisconsin in Madison. Participants will learn to use high throughput
computing (HTC) to harness vast amounts of computing power for research,
applicable to nearly any field of study (e.g., physics, chemistry,
engineering, life sciences, earth sciences, agricultural and animal
sciences, economics, social sciences, medicine, and more).

Using lectures, discussions, roleplays, and lots of hands-on work with
OSG experts in HTC, participants will learn how HTC systems work, how to
run and manage many jobs and huge datasets, how to implement a realistic
scientific computing workflow, and where to turn for help and more info.

Worried about costs? We pay all basic travel, hotel, and food costs for
applicants who are selected to attend. This is a valuable offer!

Ideal candidates are graduate students whose research involves or could
involve large-scale computing - work that cannot be done on one laptop
or a handful of computers. Also, we accept some post-doctoral students,
faculty, staff, and advanced undergraduates, so make a strong case for
yourself regardless of your current role!

IMPORTANT DATES
   Application Period (OPEN NOW): 1 March - 14 April 2017
