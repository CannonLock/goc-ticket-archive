---+++Meeting with DOEGrids on March 11, 2011

 

Attendees: Mike, Dhiva, Alain D, Greg, Mine, and Anand.

Free form notes from the meeting.

 

   * There are some attributes that were not used in the older software version. Doug is working on these.  

   * Dhiva is focusing on CA software changes.

   * Mike is working on Classical RA Agent interface. he is customizing off-the-box web interfaces to match existing RA service interfaces. This will need another 8 hours to complete. We will set up another meeting next week. He started a mock up user enrollment web page. This is not complete yet.

   * Each RA instance can run standalone. OSG, NERSC, ESnet can each run their own RA service, customized to their needs. This is a very appealing feature. OSG can run a service at GOC customized for OSG users. 

   * In Doug’s summary of features table, some items labeled as “not impl”. We are not sure what it means: whether it cannot be implemented or not implemented yet.

   * Email notifications are labeled as N/A and "not impl". Dhiva however clarified that this feature is available. It is not yet configured to use the right email lists.  

   * OSG has a *wish list*.

      * OSG wants to include the sponsors in the Agent workflow. Currently, all communication between the Agent and the sponsor is through emails. We want sponsors to login to the service directly and perform their work in the service. So, we can eliminate the emails between the agent and sponsors.

      * Mike says there is no reason that cannot be done. Dhiva thinks the Agent workflow is not part of the RA service software. This may mean significant changes to the code. He suggests incorporating an external service to track the interactions between the agents and the sponsors such as a ticketing system. Mine thinks if the sponsors can get low-privileged group accounts without changing the ra software or database significantly, this could be a solution. Sponsors can directly view the requests in the service and put their decisions as comments. Mike thinks this could be do-able. They have abilitites to create groups.

      * Listing of Agents: OSG wants to have a web interface that can handle agent addition, listing, and removing. This is the same interface we already have for GridAdmins. Dhiva says this is already included in the new RA service.

      * Agent requests to the RA: OSG wants to have the initial agent requests to be sent from the RA service interface. Similar to a new user sending a certificate request, a new agent to-be, sends a request to the RA via the web interface. Mike thinks this should be doable.

      * Archival of request decisions: Currently OSG agents sends external emails to various archival lists to keep records of request decisions. Can we record these decisions in RA instance? Mike thinks this is not possible. RA database is not meant for archival. He suggests copying the RA database to an external database periodically. There are already easy-to-use API. Mike says they have no plans yet for the data retention in RA service.

      * OSG wishes to access a RA service instance with interfaces similar to existing RA service. Mike thinks he can finish this by next week. We will set up another meeting to take a look at the service.

      * OSG uses command line scripts to access OSG RA and CA interfaces. We like to assess which features in our scripts will need updating based on the new feature set. Doug’s summary shows many features as N/A for the command line access.

      * Dhiva is leaving for a vacation next week. He will be back April 9th. Mike will be on travel after next week.
