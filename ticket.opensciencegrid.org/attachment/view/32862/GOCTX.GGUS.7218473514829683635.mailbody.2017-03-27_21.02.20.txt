Hereâ€™s what I ended up going with for the job router entries on the CE.  You can see the values for memory and wall time:

JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES = \
[ \
  # Route to queue called moonshot \
  GridResource = "batch pbs"; \
  TargetUniverse = 9; \
  name = "Local_PBS_moonshot"; \
# Max Mem 4GB \
  set_default_maxMemory=4096; \
# Max WallTime 48 hours \
  set_default_maxWallTime=172800; \
  set_default_queue=moonshot; \
# Core count = 8 \
  set_default_xcount=8;\
  Requirements = (TARGET.queue =?= "moonshot"); \
] \
[ \
  # Route to queue called dellblades \
  GridResource = "batch pbs"; \
  TargetUniverse = 9; \
  name = "Local_PBS_dellblades"; \
# Max Mem 2GB \
  set_default_maxMemory=2048; \
# Max WallTime 48 hours \
  set_default_maxWallTime=172800; \
  set_default_queue=dellblades; \
# Core count = 16 \
  set_default_xcount=16;\
  Requirements = (TARGET.queue =?= "dellblades"); \ 
]

I ran the condor_ce_reconfig after making the changes to 99-local.conf.  Is there anything else I need to do?

Cheers,

    Hi Mike,
    
    It sounds like there is some confusion here. Let me try to clarify .... 
    
    First, your job router recipes in update#34 look correct for specifying the difference queues we may target when submitting glideins from the factories. Second, as indicated in the Job Router Recipes documentation [1], you may also set a default/maximum number of cores, memory, and/or wall clock time for each route using the set_default_* options you mentioned in update#36. 
    
    In addition to these set_default_* options in your job router entries, we will also set on the factory-side the requested number of cores, memory, and wall clock time per glidein when we submit them to your HTCondor-CE. On our side, these requested values should be equal to or less than your any maximum limits you set either in your job route entries and/or local PBS batch/queue limits. These "submit attributes" set at the factory are the slightly different syntax Marian was referring to in update#35. i.e., we set +maxMemory, +maxWallTime, and +xcount in the factory.
    
    So I think all we need from you to correctly configure the moonshot entry in the factory is:
    
    1. What is the number of cores we should use in the glideins submitted to the moonshot queue? e.g., CMS standard multicore glidein is 8-cores.
    2. What is the amount of available memory per core for jobs in the moonshot queue? e.g., minimum is 2 GB per core.
    3. What is the maximum wall clock limit for a job in the moonshot queue? e.g., typical CMS site is 48 hours.
