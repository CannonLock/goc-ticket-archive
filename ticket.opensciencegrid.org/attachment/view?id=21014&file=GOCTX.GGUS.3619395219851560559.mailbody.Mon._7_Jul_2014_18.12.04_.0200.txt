Greetings,
     
summarise Simone&#39;s, Marian&#39;s and my response on the issue:
 http://cern.ch/go/LZ8P [1]
 as you see, both computing elements in the two sites in NET2 had
problems over the month. The plots which are shown in
http://egg.bu.edu/net2/studies%7btype:egg.Hatch%7d/availability-April-2014/
[2]
The point of the link above and my discussion with you guys in May was
to demonstrate that it is not at all true that "the two sites in NET2
had problems over the month" as you say above.  The two main points
are: 
o WLCG says that we were available 78% of the time, but I demonstrated
that we had no down times and, in fact, successfully finished PanDA
jobs in every hour of the month.
o The job failure rates that Edward refers to below are in no way an
indication of a problem at NET2.  To demonstrate this, I pointed out
(confirming with Edward&#39;s plots as well) that the job success
rates are essentially identical with the rates for AGLT2 (84.26% vs
85.69%).  In other words, we had, in fact, 100% up time and exactly
the same error rate as AGLT2 which was 99% available according to
WLCG. 
My conclusion is that the WLCG availability numbers in general are
just not measuring "availability" in any reasonable sense.  Reporting
these numbers as "site availability" is just wrong.  A quick fix to
this would be to report them in some qualified way such as "SAM
availability" and, in the longer term, to find a better way to measure
this. 
- Saul  show no evidence that SAM tests are measuring wrong
availability as they show completed jobs but do not show failures, nor
effects of
 retries. In practice, if the Computing Element is 50% available, the
ATLAS pilot factory will still be able to submit jobs, but this does
not mean the service at the site (the CE) is healthy. I guess we can
discuss how representative the current critical metrices are for the
site health status, but this should be done in ATLAS meetings rather
than in WLCG fora, as the definition of ATLAS critical tests is up to
ATLAS. The ADC weekly meeting on Tuesdays is a good place.

 Most of the failures are in job submission and are either due to job
aborts (due to timeouts on job states set by ATLAS), or timeouts in
WMS. A comprehensive discussion on the timeout issue and possible
evolution for the future took place at February&#39;s GDB:
 https://indico.cern.ch/event/272618/ [4] (SAM Test Scheduling by Luca
Magnoni)
 The conclusion was that instead of tuning WMS timeouts, we focus our
attention on development of the probes based on Condor-G as WMS is to
be decommissioned and Condor-G will anyway better reflect experiment
workflow and wouldn&#39;t suffer from WMS, BDII issues we&#39;re
observing. As of now, we have finalized the developments on Condor-G
probes and are about to start validating this in SAM ATLAS
pre-production.
 Also, there were 11.17% of failures and 4.56% of cancelled jobs at
the US-NET2 federation during the month of April as you can see at
[1]. Note that I have included ALL panda jobs and not just the
production ones.
 You can also find the job efficiency (successful/all jobs) over the
month of April which is basically 88.78% (fourth plot from [1]). You
can also find the data in json at [2]. For example, the job efficiency
on 1st of April was 61.99% as you can also see at [3].
