The logs get back to the factory, but they don't have their permissions set properly, and our monitoring lists them with an unknown wallclock time and no user jobs having run. Additionally, I'm seeing evidence of some sort of permissions issue in some of the stderr logs for the glideins [1] when it comes time to clean up. Plus, the fact they all only seem to be running one user job and no more is rather suspicious. I've spent a lot of time today trying to find more information on this, but there's nothing in any of the logs that would point to what's causing this problems. I don't think it's a factory issue though, as this is the only site having issues and we haven't changed anything.
