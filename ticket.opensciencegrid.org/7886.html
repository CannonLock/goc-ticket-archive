Summary*        &#58; Some suggestions with regard to quota
Notes           &#58; Ian--here is my reply to the questions you answered.  I will watch if it goes to footprints, usually
it does.

<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;FootPrints Ticket Description&#58;</font>
<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;Will our ticket systems talk to each other?  I&#39;m interested to find out.</font>
<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;</font>
<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;Chris Green has given a heads up on this.  If we&#39;ve exhausted quota,</font>
<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;what action can we take?  I would have thought no jobs would run if they</font>
<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;can&#39;t stage in a probe and/or cleanup script.  Should we resort to</font>
<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;globus-job-run?</font>

If you actually fail in staging in the tarball then the job would hold.  The
jobs that crash would be those that were trying to write output to the same area.

<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;Also, we&#39;re trying to understand what action makes sense in general --</font>
<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;we thought it was fine to leave a job without doing any clean up, and</font>
<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;that sites would do this themselves either on a per-job basis, or with</font>
<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;some kind of regular tmpwatch like mechanism.  This is certainly what we</font>
<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;have happening on our local systems.</font>

We do have a tmpwatch-like system but it only runs weekly starting on Sunday morning.
Generally the only time there will be something left over from a job is if the job aborts for
whatever reason.  when you have a lot of big jobs that get aborted, which is what
happened just before Christmas, the home directory fills up very quickly.

<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;Does the quota include $OSG_APP and $OSG_DATA spaces?  We have several</font>
<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;GB of data that we are staging to these areas. (in the sbgrid subdirectory).</font>

At Fermilab, all sbgrid users map to uid sbgrid and gid sbgrid.  there is a vo-by-vo
<div id='show_58565376' class=''><button class="btn">Show More</button></div><div class='detail hidden' id='detail_58565376'>quota on OSG_APP (30GB) and OSG_DATA(400GB) which is
separate from the home area (10GB).

<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;Is it possible to confirm which grid user is creating the data?  We have</font>
<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;3 active users right now.  Most likely it is me.</font>

&#92;All the files end up being owned by the same user but our job logs indicate that
it was you who was running at the time.

<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;I&#39;ve just tried du in the home directory, and I only seem to see 1.5 GB</font>
<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;$ globus-job-run fermigridosg1.fnal.gov /usr/bin/du -ks .</font>
<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;1510176 .</font>

That&#39;s right.  A lot of the stuff has already been auto-cleaned by our script. In fact you
caught it while our autocleaner is running.

<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;I&#39;ve just tmpwatched it for +4h, but I get &#34;failed to unlink&#34; errors.</font>

<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;$ globus-job-run fermigridosg1.fnal.gov /usr/sbin/tmpwatch 4 .</font>
<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;error&#58; failed to unlink /grid/testhome/sbgrid/gramsave&#58; sbgrid.2.tar.gz</font>
<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;</font>
<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;After this command, there was 212 MB of space left.  I was interested to</font>
<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;see where the 1.3 GB was, but I could find no way to execute the</font>
<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;equivalent of &#34;du -s $HOME/*&#34; that would suitably escape the *.</font>

On a fork job with globus-job-run you start in $HOME (which for you is /grid/testhome/sbgrid)
On a condor job you start in $HOME/gram_scratch_xxxxxxxxxx
where xxxxxxxxxx is created new for every job.

<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;FWIW, we run &#34;quota&#34; in our job preambles, so we can track how close to</font>
<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;the system limits we may be for the jobs we&#39;re creating and submitting.</font>
<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;I can&#39;t easily read the result from FNAL due to formatting problems, but</font>
<font color='#7F7E6F'>&#62;as best I can tell, it doesn&#39;t show user utilization&#58;</font>

The line you care about is the one for fgnas0&#58;/fermigrid-home.
And all sbgrid users are lumped together on our end into a single group account.

At the moment the quota doesn&#39;t match the output of du -s, I am checking why that might be.

Hi Chris,

These are jobs I&#39;m running, or trying to run.  Their pattern of
execution is to do some initial setup (in whatever directory the job
initially lands in), then to move all files to $OSG_WN_TMP if it exists,
or /tmp otherwise (in fact, a job-specific subdirectory of this scratch
directory).  The job executes, zips up any files that were generated,
returns to the initial job directory, copies the zip file back, and
exits.  It does not clean up the scratch dir other than deleting (or
attempting to delete) a few specific files (some of these can be a few
MB but not larger).

If something other than this is happening, then there is a bug in my job
submission system and wrapper script.
Steve Timm and I were in conversation last week or earlier this week
about the problem of passing &#34;*.mtz&#34; as an argument in the classad --
This was leading to strange failures at FNAL two weeks ago, and last
week I blocked at least one FNAL site from  our target site list.  It is
possible that my attempts to fix this problem for FNAL job submission
created another problem.

I am leaving on vacation this afternoon, but Peter Doherty (cc&#39;ed) will
be available today and tomorrow.  Please email &#34;hpc@....&#34; with any
problems so they go into our ticketing system.

I&#39;ll run some specific tests this morning and look at jobs that have run
at FNAL to see if there are obvious problems.

Hi,

Since last night, SBGrid has been hitting home filesystem quota limits
on FNAL_FERMIGRID and friends. This is just a preliminary heads-up to
see if you immediately know who might be doing this and get them to
stop. Steve will probably put in a formal ticket when he gets in.

scale up job submission again and are able to see if jobs are completing
successfully.

It appeared the problem was a combination of our jobs and some local
problems they were having there.

There are some questions I posed that are still relevant and unanswered
regarding quota and disk space between 4 areas&#58;

1. where a job starts
2. scratch space (where we move our job execution to)
3. OSG_APP
4. OSG_DATA

Keith supplied me with your DN as the offending user at which point I CC&#39;d you, so they are your jobs unless you have some kind of submit node that uses your DN or some such thing. Fermilab crew, please revisit this issue, I am sending this last update from Ian into the FNAL ticket system to see that it goes to Steve or Chris as appropriate.

-----------------
Will our ticket systems talk to each other?  I&#39;m interested to find out.

Chris Green has given a heads up on this.  If we&#39;ve exhausted quota,
what action can we take?  I would have thought no jobs would run if they
can&#39;t stage in a probe and/or cleanup script.  Should we resort to
globus-job-run?

Also, we&#39;re trying to understand what action makes sense in general --
we thought it was fine to leave a job without doing any clean up, and
that sites would do this themselves either on a per-job basis, or with
some kind of regular tmpwatch like mechanism.  This is certainly what we
have happening on our local systems.

Does the quota include $OSG_APP and $OSG_DATA spaces?  We have several
GB of data that we are staging to these areas. (in the sbgrid subdirectory).

Is it possible to confirm which grid user is creating the data?  We have
3 active users right now.  Most likely it is me.

I&#39;ve just tried du in the home directory, and I only seem to see 1.5 GB

$ globus-job-run fermigridosg1.fnal.gov /usr/bin/du -ks .
1510176 .

I&#39;ve just tmpwatched it for +4h, but I get &#34;failed to unlink&#34; errors.

$ globus-job-run fermigridosg1.fnal.gov /usr/sbin/tmpwatch 4 .
<div id='show_358344064' class=''><button class="btn">Show More</button></div><div class='detail hidden' id='detail_358344064'>error&#58; failed to unlink /grid/testhome/sbgrid/gramsave&#58; sbgrid.2.tar.gz

After this command, there was 212 MB of space left.  I was interested to
see where the 1.3 GB was, but I could find no way to execute the
equivalent of &#34;du -s $HOME/*&#34; that would suitably escape the *.

FWIW, we run &#34;quota&#34; in our job preambles, so we can track how close to
the system limits we may be for the jobs we&#39;re creating and submitting.
I can&#39;t easily read the result from FNAL due to formatting problems, but
as best I can tell, it doesn&#39;t show user utilization&#58;
